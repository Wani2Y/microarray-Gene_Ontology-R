## project "GO Enrichment analysis TB mice"
This project is a personal entertaiment and learning project.

## Description
This project uses published molecular data to explore the relative abundance of biological processes in mice infected by $\textit{Mycobacterium tuberculosis}$ with three groups of doagnosible conditions. 
This project contains the R script for replicating the analysis and the RNoteBook for running the analysis by step. 
The raw data is not provided in this project, but it is downloaded from GEO as part of the script. 
A rendered html document is also provided for education purposes.
